\href{http://www.xythobuz.de/xycontrol/}{\tt xy\-Control} is a Quadrocopter Flight Controller based on Atmels Atmega2560 microcontroller. It features 512\-K\-B S\-R\-A\-M on-\/board, using the external memory interface of this processor. Also included is a switched power supply as well as a U\-S\-B connection to communicate with and program the target. All I/\-O pins, including 3 additional U\-A\-R\-Ts, S\-P\-I, I2\-C (T\-W\-I) and 16 A\-D\-C Channels, are accessible via standard 2.\-54mm connectors. The Board can be powered from an external stable 5\-V supply, U\-S\-B or 7\-V or more, via the on-\/board switched power supply. All voltage sources can be selected via jumpers.

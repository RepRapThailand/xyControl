xy\-Control is a Quadrocopter Flight Controller based on Atmels Atmega2560 microcontroller. It features 512\-K\-B S\-R\-A\-M on-\/board, using the external memory interface of this processor. Also included is a switched power supply as well as a U\-S\-B connection to communicate with and program the target. All I/\-O pins, including 3 additional U\-A\-R\-Ts, S\-P\-I, I2\-C (T\-W\-I) and 16 A\-D\-C Channels, are accessible via standard 2.\-54mm connectors. The Board can be powered from an external stable 5\-V supply, U\-S\-B or 7\-V or more, via the on-\/board switched power supply. All voltage sources can be selected via jumpers.

\subsection*{Known Problems}

In the current P\-C\-B layout, the S\-D-\/\-Card holder is rotated 180 degrees. This prevents an S\-D-\/\-Card from being inserted!

\subsection*{Flight Control Software Flow}

Three tasks are controlling the Quadrocopter Orientation in Space.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Orientation Task reads the Gyroscope and Accelerometer and calculates the current Roll and Pitch angles. They are stored in the global struct \char`\"{}orientation\char`\"{}.
\item The P\-I\-D Task is then feeding these angles into two P\-I\-D controllers. Their output is then used by...
\item The Set Task, which calculates the motor speeds and gives them to...
\item The motor task, which sends the new values via T\-W\-I to the motor controllers.

\subsection*{External Memory (\hyperlink{xmem_8h}{xmem.\-h})}

The external memory consists of a 512\-Kx8 S\-R\-A\-M, bank-\/switched onto the 16bit avr address space. This gives us 8 memory banks, consisting of 56\-K\-B. All memory from 0x0000 to 0x21\-F\-F is the A\-V\-Rs internal memory. The memory banks are switched into 0x2200 to 0x\-F\-F\-F\-F. This gives us 8 banks with 56\-K\-B each, resulting in 448\-K\-B external R\-A\-M.

The data and bss memory sections, as well as the Stack are located in the internal R\-A\-M. The external R\-A\-M is used only for dynamically allocated memory.

\subsection*{Orientation Calculation (\hyperlink{orientation_8h}{orientation.\-h})}

Calculates the current angles of the platform, using Gyroscope and Accelerometer Data with a \hyperlink{struct_kalman}{Kalman} Filter. It is using this slightly modified \href{http://www.linushelgesson.se/2012/04/pitch-and-roll-estimating-kalman-filter-for-stabilizing-quadrocopters/}{\tt Kalman Filter Implementation} by Linus Helgesson.

\section*{P\-C and Android Tools}

You can find some P\-C Software in the 'tools' directory. Each one should be accompanied by it's own Readme file.

# xyCopter

This Android App is able to connect to the Quadrocopter via Bluetooth ([BTM-222](http://www.xythobuz.org/index.php?p=bt)) and send and receive control commands and debug informations.
You can find the latest version as unsigned APK in the parent directory.

This is using my fork of the [GraphView Library](https://github.com/Lauszus/GraphView). I hacked it a bit, so now zero is always the center of the Y-Axis and the legend is displayed on the left.
